# Testing - Mini

Topics:
  * Mocha
  * Chai
  * Sinon
  * Assert
  * Expect


## Project Description

* The objective is to get you exposed to using TDD with Mocha/Chai and Sinon.
* You will be writing tests for the code inside of `src/app.js`.

### Initialize Project

* cd into repo and run `npm install`

### Pre Set Up

* You'll notice we have two directories `src` and `test`. Inside of `src/app.js` you'll see all the code that we want to test, being exported out of `app.js` in the bottom of the file.
* Go ahead and run `npm test` and it will exectute the testing suites.

### Steps for implementing Tests

* Step 1: You have a broken test suite already, go ahead and change each test assertion such that it passes the expected test. Everything begins on line 14 inside of `tests/app.test.js` begin there.
